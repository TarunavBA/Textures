## FAQ's

Q1. Will there be any problem if i use these textures without giving proper credit to the owner of the Textures? 

Ans: There won't be a problem but to be safe you can suggest my name as a superscript (<sup>Thanks to {NAME OF THE OWNER OF THIS REPOSITORY} </sup>) but you can't take the WHOLE credit of the textures for your self. Look at the permissions and limitations below ‚¨áÔ∏è
