## FAQ's

Q1. Will there be any problem if i use these textures without giving proper credit to the owner of the Textures? 

Ans: There won't be a problem but to be safe you can suggest my name as a superscript (```<sup>Thanks to [TarunavBA](https://github.com/TarunavBA/) for textures </sup>```) 
but you can't take the WHOLE credit of the textures for your self. Look at the permissions and limitations ⬆️
